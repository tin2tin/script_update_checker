"Add-on update helper script

I found I was regularly overlooking outdated code when doing add-on updates, so I made a very basic helper script to speed up the update process. This script goes through an add-on files and look for lines that might have outdated 2.7x code. If possibly outdated code is found, the code and its line number are printed in the console along with a small note on what to look at.

Please keep in mind this script will not catch everything and tends to generate a lot of false positives, but it has saved me quite a bit of time when updating add-ons for 2.8."
